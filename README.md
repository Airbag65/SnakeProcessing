# SnakeProcessing
Snake Game made in processing.
This is a snake game I am currently working on for a schoolassignment in my programming class. 
It is rather buggy and not well optimized at all, 
but it is my first ever game project that I have gotten to work how I wanted.

## Update 5 feb 2021
Added the losingCaseSelf() function to which senses collision 
with other parts of the snake. This means that the snake can no 
logner go through itself.
